# Typescript/Karma/Webpack Template
This repository contains a bare-bones template for starting TypeScript projects with Karma and Webpack. I like these tools but always struggle to get new projects started efficiently.

#### Notes
You should be able to clone this repo, install the dependencies, run tests, build your bundled output, and hit breakpoints in your debugger.

```
npm install
npm test
webpack -w
```
